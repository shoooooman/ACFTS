\maketitle

\section{Week 0~(10/7$\sim$10/11)}
\textbf{First Meeting}

Summarized my first thoughts.

\section{Week 1~(10/14$\sim$10/18)}
\textbf{Research on related works}

List up related works and find undiscovered areas to establish the purpose of our project.

\section{Week 2~(10/21$\sim$10/25)}
\textbf{Build a model}

Define a model of transaction systems.
The model would include definitions of transactions, nodes, networks, etc.

\section{Week 3~(10/28$\sim$11/1)}
\textbf{Give algorithms}

Give algorithms upon the model for payment transaction systems.
The algorithms would show how transactions are recorded into the systems, how the systems are able to prevent double-spending problems, etc.

\section{Week 4$\sim$7~(11/4$\sim$11/29)}
\textbf{Implement transaction systems}

Implement transaction systems based on the model and the algorithms.\\

\noindent
\emph{Implementation schedule}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design transaction systems \& Select a language
    \item Implement network model~(Be able to make transactions, broadcast them and add them to transaction ledger)
    \item Implement verification algorithm~(Be able to abort incorrect transactions)
    \item Adapt to changing topology~(Be able to allow to exchange the set of nodes)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Week 8~(12/2$\sim$12/6)}
\textbf{Analyze with benchmarks}

\section{Week 9$\sim$10~(12/9$\sim$12/20)}
\textbf{Write a report and make a presentation on findings}
